	INSTALL      The file you're reading right now.
	LICENSE      This files contains the terms under wich you may
	             use, modify, and redistribute code2html. Be sure
	             to read and understand it.

	refactor_highlighting.py A code refactoring tool to process older
	                         HTML-documents; removes the <FONT>-tags
	                         and replaces them with appropriate
	                         <SPAN>-tags with CSS-styles.


o Location of your perl interpreter

	If your perl interpreter is not /usr/bin/perl (do a `which
	perl') you will have to change the first line in code2html to
	reflect your location.

o Copy Files

	To install code2html on your system, copy the code2html file
	itself to /usr/local/bin/ and make sure it has mode 755.

	Then copy code2html.1 to your man1 directory, usually
	/usr/local/man/man1/. It needs to have mode 644.

	Additinally you may want to copy the rest du
	/usr/share/doc/code2html or /usr/local/share/doc/code2html.

	If you have older, static HTML files with the <FONT>-tags
	you may want to also copy the file refactor_highlighting.py
	to your /usr/local/bin/ directory and make sure it has
	mode 755.

	  file                        destination           mode
	 -------------------------------------------------------
	  code2html                   /usr/local/bin/       0755
	  refachtor_highlighting.py   /usr/local/bin/       0755
	  code2html.1                 /usr/local/man/man1/  0644

That's it, have fun.
