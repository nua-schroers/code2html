[For details on installing code2html see the INSTALL file]

This is the README for code2html, a tool wich allows you to convert
your source code files to syntax highlighted HTML. In the future other 
output-formats may be added, the hooks to support this are already
there.

This fork of code2html has been patched to support the following
additional features: Replace the older, deprecated <FONT>-tags with
<SPAN>-tags that are configured using CSS. The <B>, <STRONG>, <I> and
<U>-tags are likewise replaced with the appropriate CSS-styles. The
CORBA IDL-language is now supported with appropriate syntax-
highlighting. The patch is distributed via http://www.field-theory.org
since I (Wolfram Schroers) have not managed to contact the original
author of code2html.

For options and details please query the man-page which is distributed 
together with code2thml. In short, there are 3 ways to use code2html:

o Convert a simple source-code file to HTML. For example to convert
  the code2html perl script itself to an HTML file, use

	code2html code2html out.html

  The first part ('code2html') calls the program itself, the second
  block is the source file, where code2html should take the
  source-code to syntax highlight from, and the third and last part is 
  the desitination file.

  The source and destination files are optional, if not given STDIN
  and STDOUT will be used.

o Use code2html in patch mode. Code2html allows you to have inline
  source code in an HTML file. It can then take this file and replace
  the source code in the HTML file with its syntax highlighted
  counterpart. 

  For details see the man-page.

o At last code2html can also be used as a CGI script.

  See the man-page and the example at

  for details.


Have fun.
